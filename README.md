# Lively.next Cookbook

A living cookbook of practical patterns, widgets, and design examples for [Lively.next](https://lively-next.org).

This repository is a collection of small, focused examples—designed to help developers and designers understand how to build with Lively’s Morphic system. Each recipe is a working component or pattern that can be used directly or adapted into larger systems.

## ✨ Goals

- Provide **clear, working examples** of useful Lively.next patterns
- Encourage **reuse and understanding** through readable, minimal code
- Build a foundation for **community collaboration** and discovery

## 🧩 What's Inside

- `components/`: Reusable widgets (e.g. file pickers, dialogs)
- `examples/`: Full example setups with usage code
- `docs/`: Architecture notes, design commentary, and deeper dives

## 📚 Recipes So Far

- [FileBrowserMorph](components/FileBrowserMorph.js) – A simple popup file picker for navigating Jupyter file systems, with back, up, open/save, and close.

More coming soon.
